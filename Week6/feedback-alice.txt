Additional Comments:

Everything is working. Your array and for loop look good. You could have written it like this to save having to type all those <option>s in the array:

  var cities = ["NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"];

  for (var i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
    $("#city-type").append($("<option>" + cities[i] + "</option>"));

The way you did it is completely fine, it works, but this way involves a little less code by making the loop do all the work.

Overall, well done. And I like that you put that little background picture on the dropdown box.
