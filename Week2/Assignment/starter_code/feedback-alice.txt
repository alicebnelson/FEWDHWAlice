Additional Comments:

Hey, you did the enhanced layout! Awesome! This looks really good. Your nesting of elements looks great, and you definitely are getting the hang of using divs.

One little thing: I think you used "visited" incorrectly in the CSS on line 298. It's not a property like color or margin. It's a pseudo selector like hover. You use it like this:

.signUpButtonText:visited {
  color: red;
}

So it's like, when this class has this state on it (the link has already been visited), display it like this.

But I'm really impressed that you were trying out new CSS properties.

Well done! Let me know if you have any questions.
