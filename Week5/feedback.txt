Additional Comments:

- Great job! All the functionality is there and your javascript is clean and readable. Everything is properly indented and your variable & function names are concise and descriptive.

- Good use of the '===' operator to compare both value and type.

- Good use of .trim() to remove extra white space.

- Good use of .toLowerCase() to show the appropriate image regardless of how the input is cased.
